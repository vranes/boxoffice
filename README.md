Vue.js - Node.js web application for logging movies and reviews

- Backend is done in Node.js with Express framework
- REST API for accessing the database
- Frontend is done with Vue.js framework and Vue Router library
- Bootstrap was used for page views
- Input validation ensured on both frontend and backend

Vue.js was originally compiled and included in Node.js to be shown as static files, but here I provided the Vue.js source code
